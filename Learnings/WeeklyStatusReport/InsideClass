Week 1:
1) I learnt that how easy it is to propose ideas to make some improvements in the prevailing version of an application.

2) I learnt how essential it is to convey customer requirements to a software engineer and what role communication plays in between.

3) I came accross the fact that software engineering is still a vague terminology.

Week 2:
1) Learnt about the Life Cycle Model.
2) Got familiar with some of the formal terms related to Software Engineering.
3) Read about Software Requirements Specifications(SRS).

Week 3:
1) It was the time I realised that proposing ideas is not always easy :p. I felt it when I had to propose an idea for the group project and every idea seemed to be taken away by some other person :p
2) Requirement Engineering was one of the interesting topics. The session by Arihant sir went nice and also got to learn why we should design a software all.
3) Also got to know about MIT SCRATCH.
At last, I would say that I did not mention much of the technical terms discussed in the class yet I learnt the key idea behind those :) Can be subjected to verifcation :p.
